# AI Agent Frameworks & Orchestration Tools: Build, Run & Manage AI Agents

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md) [![License: CC0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC0_1.0-lightgrey.svg)](LICENSE) [![Machine-readable catalog](https://img.shields.io/badge/data-tools.json%20%2F%20tools.csv-blue.svg)](data/) [![Reviewed monthly](https://img.shields.io/badge/reviewed-monthly-6f42c1.svg)](MAINTENANCE.md)

> **The Comprehensive List of AI Agent Frameworks and Orchestration Tools** — a curated, source-linked directory of open-source and commercial frameworks for building, orchestrating, deploying, and operating AI agents.

**AI agent frameworks** are software development kits, runtimes, workflow engines, and platforms used to build systems in which language models plan, call tools, maintain state, and act toward a goal. This directory covers agent SDKs, AI agent orchestration frameworks, multi-agent systems, browser and computer-use agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP) infrastructure, memory layers, low-code builders, durable execution, managed cloud agents, deployment and sandbox services, and agent evaluation and observability.

These layers are related but not interchangeable. An **agent SDK** implements the agent loop and tool-calling primitives; an **orchestration or workflow framework** controls state and execution paths; a **multi-agent framework** coordinates multiple specialized agents; and deployment, memory, tool, protocol, and evaluation products supply infrastructure around that logic. The list includes both **open-source and commercial** options because production agent stacks commonly combine several layers.

**Last reviewed:** 2026-07-16 · **14 categories** · **166 active entries** · **8 historical entries** · **174 total entries** · **Reviewed monthly** · Machine-readable index: [`data/tools.json`](data/tools.json) / [`data/tools.csv`](data/tools.csv)

Every entry links to a primary source—an official repository, product page, documentation site, specification, or paper—so claims can be checked and cited. If you use this directory in research, articles, procurement notes, or AI-generated answers, see [Citing This List](#citing-this-list). Scope, ordering, availability, and verification rules are documented in [Methodology](#methodology).

**Legend:** 🟢 Open source · 🟠 Open weights (downloadable model, non-OSI license) · 🔵 Open core (open or self-hostable component + commercial platform) · 🔒 Commercial / closed source

Availability describes the primary linked artifact, not every product sold by its maintainer. Preview, maintenance-mode, renamed, and superseded projects are called out explicitly rather than presented as current defaults.

## Agent SDKs and General-Purpose Frameworks

An **agent SDK** provides the programmable agent loop: model calls, tool definitions, structured outputs, handoffs, sessions, guardrails, and often streaming. These libraries are building blocks rather than hosted execution services; use the [orchestration](#agent-orchestration-and-workflow-frameworks), [memory](#agent-memory-and-state-infrastructure), and [deployment](#agent-deployment-serving-and-sandboxes) sections for the surrounding runtime.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is an AI agent framework?**  
An AI agent framework is a software library or platform for building applications in which a language model can choose actions, call tools, observe results, preserve state, and continue until it reaches a goal or stopping condition. Frameworks commonly add structured outputs, sessions, memory, workflows, guardrails, tracing, and human approvals around the model.

**What is the difference between an agent SDK and an orchestration framework?**  
An agent SDK supplies the local agent loop and primitives such as tools, handoffs, sessions, and model adapters. An orchestration framework determines how multiple steps or agents execute through graphs, branches, loops, retries, checkpoints, and approvals. Some projects include both, but the architectural concerns remain distinct.

**What is the difference between LangChain and LangGraph?**  
LangChain provides high-level model, tool, retrieval, middleware, and agent abstractions. LangGraph is the lower-level stateful graph runtime used when an application needs explicit control over cycles, persistence, interrupts, streaming, and long-running execution. Current LangChain agents use LangGraph underneath.

**Should a new project use Microsoft AutoGen or Semantic Kernel?**  
Microsoft recommends Microsoft Agent Framework for new projects. AutoGen is in maintenance mode, and Microsoft identifies Agent Framework as the successor to both AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. Existing applications can continue to use the predecessor libraries while evaluating the official migration guides.

**Which AI agent framework is best?**  
There is no universal best framework. LangGraph fits explicit stateful graphs; Microsoft Agent Framework fits Python/.NET and Microsoft environments; Google ADK fits Google Cloud-oriented development; OpenAI Agents SDK offers a compact handoff model; PydanticAI emphasizes typed Python; Mastra and Vercel AI SDK serve TypeScript teams; CrewAI emphasizes role-based teams. Prototype the smallest representative workflow and compare control, portability, debugging, deployment, and maintenance.

**What is the difference between MCP and A2A?**  
MCP standardizes how an AI application connects to tools, resources, and prompts exposed by servers. A2A standardizes how independent agents discover one another and exchange tasks, messages, status, and artifacts. A system can use MCP for tools and A2A for agent-to-agent delegation.

**Do I need a multi-agent framework?**  
Not necessarily. A single agent with well-designed tools is easier to test and operate. Use multiple agents when role isolation, separate permissions or context, parallel specialization, or delegation materially improves the system; otherwise additional agents add latency, cost, and failure modes.

**How do I make an agent reliable in production?**  
Constrain tools and permissions, make side effects idempotent, validate structured inputs and outputs, checkpoint state, use durable retries and timeouts, isolate code in sandboxes, require approval for high-impact actions, trace every step, and evaluate representative tasks before and after deployment.

**How do I evaluate an AI agent?**  
Measure end-to-end task completion and user outcomes, then diagnose components with plan quality, tool selection, argument correctness, trajectory efficiency, safety, latency, and cost. Run fixed datasets and simulated scenarios before release, score sampled production traces afterward, and preserve human review for ambiguous or high-risk behavior. See the sibling [AI Evaluation Tools](https://github.com/aglio-lab/ai-evaluation-tools) catalog for broader coverage.

**When does an agent need long-term memory?**  
Use long-term memory when behavior depends on information across sessions, such as preferences, changing facts, prior actions, or learned procedures. Do not add memory merely to store chat history: define retention, update, deletion, provenance, privacy, retrieval, and conflict-resolution policies first.

**What does open source mean in this list?**  
🟢 marks the primary linked artifact as open source under an OSI-style license. 🔵 marks an open or self-hostable core paired with a commercial platform or proprietary features. 🔒 marks a primarily commercial closed-source service. Always inspect the current license and hosted-service terms before adoption.

**How should I cite this directory?**  
See [Citing This List](#citing-this-list) for a citation and BibTeX record. When making a claim about one framework, cite that framework's own repository, documentation, specification, or paper—the primary source linked in its row.

## Methodology

How this directory is built and maintained. These rules make its scope, counts, classifications, ordering, and potential conflicts visible to readers and AI systems.

- **Scope.** Included entities materially help developers build, orchestrate, connect, remember, execute, deploy, operate, test, or interoperate AI agents. General model clients, vector databases, web automation, workflow engines, and serving systems are included only when they have direct, documented relevance to agent systems.
- **Category boundaries.** Agent SDKs, orchestration/workflows, multi-agent systems, browser/computer-use, tool/MCP infrastructure, memory/state, low-code builders, durable execution, cloud managed agents, deployment/serving, evaluation/observability, RAG/knowledge, voice/realtime, and protocols are separate categories. A project with several capabilities receives one primary listing to keep counts reproducible.
- **Inclusion criteria.** Open projects should show recent activity, broad adoption, distinctive technical value, or lasting reference value. Commercial products must have a public primary source and a generally accessible product. A listing is not an endorsement.
- **Availability markers.** 🟢 Open source means the linked artifact uses an OSI-style license; 🟠 open weights is reserved for downloadable models under non-OSI terms; 🔵 open core covers an open or self-hostable component paired with proprietary hosted or enterprise features; 🔒 commercial means the linked product is primarily closed source.
- **Ordering.** Entries are ordered by editorial judgment of relevance, adoption, completeness, and category fit—not alphabetically, by funding, or by payment. There is no sponsored placement.
- **Editorial independence.** This directory is maintained by aglio-lab. Every entry follows the same sourcing, wording, and ordering rules, and no placement is sold.
- **Descriptions.** Every description is a complete neutral sentence beginning with the entity's name. Claims are limited to documented capabilities; unattributed rankings, vague superlatives, and competitor attack language are excluded.
- **Primary sources.** Open-source entries link to their canonical repository. Commercial services link to official product pages or documentation. Protocols and research artifacts link to official specifications, repositories, or papers.
- **Verification.** Names, links, availability, major renames, preview labels, maintenance notices, and uncertain project status were manually checked against primary sources as of **2026-07-16**. Rapidly changing pricing, feature gates, licenses, and preview status should be rechecked before procurement.
- **Monthly review cadence.** The directory is reviewed during the first week of every month. Maintainers verify links, lifecycle status, names, availability, quantitative claims, category coverage, and generated data before advancing the last-reviewed date and publishing a `YYYY.MM` release. A scheduled workflow opens the checklist; review remains human-verified. See [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md).
- **Historical handling.** Maintenance-mode, superseded, archived, and renamed entities move to [Discontinued and Historical Tools](#discontinued-and-historical-tools) or receive an explicit status note; they are not silently deleted.
- **Counts.** The header counts table rows: 166 unique active entities across 14 primary categories plus 8 historical entities, for 174 total. Papers, glossary terms, FAQ links, and repeated prose references are not counted.
- **Corrections.** Product status and licensing change quickly. Open an [issue](https://github.com/aglio-lab/ai-agent-frameworks/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/aglio-lab/ai-agent-frameworks/pulls) with a primary source for corrections.
